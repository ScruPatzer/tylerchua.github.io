    <br>To my beloved readers, whether young, old, or in between: Grace and glory in Jesus Christ everlasting!

<b><br>Dearly beloved, a last through God’s goodness we present this work of love and the fruits of our tireless labor. 
  <br>Before now there has not yet been any approved edition of the Catholic Bible in English that was made by the youth,
  <br>of the youth, and for the youth. Catholic editions of the English Bible for the entire duration of its existence were
  <br>either polemical or scholarly works that existed either to defend or to study, respectively.

  <br><br><b>Demand for a people’s Bible.</b> IN the Middle Ages, there were very few translations of the Catholic Bible 
  <br>made in native languages. Those who could read and get educated wrote and read in Latin, so for centuries the Vulgate 
  <br>(Latin for common) Bible was used as the universal Bible for all who could read. The poor who could not read but still 
  <br>hungered to be fed by the scriptures could still lean the Gospel through picture-bibles (used by parish priests for 
  <br>instruction), stained glass windows, sermons, and plays. However, as time went on, people started to demand the Bible
  <br>in their own native language, which was provided to them by the Church long before the Protestant Reformation, except in 
  <br>English, which was fully pusblished in 1610. But over time the Bible became a textbook rather than a source of spiritual 
  <br>nourishment. The people still needed a Bible which, rather than focusing on learned scholars, focused on ordinary people, 
  <br>was not realized until 1988 when Father Alberto Rossa, C.M.F., published his Christian Community Bible, a Bible which was 
  <br>made for the masses. However, this community bible caused controversies because some of its notes, due to their pastoral 
  <br>nature, contained traces of certain views held with suspicion. However, despite this groundbreaking effort, a bible by
  <br>the youth, for the youth, and of the youth has not yet been made under the assistance of the Catholic Church until 2019 
  <br>when the Philippine Bible Society published a version  of the New Testament geared towards the youth in a mix of Tagalog 
  <br>and English. This version, called the “Pinoy Version”, was groundbreaking, as it included the common language of the Filipino
  <br>youth. This version however, due to the use of “Taglish”, was not fit for liturgical use, which was not a problem due to 
  <br>the pastoral nature of the work.

<br><br>Nowadays, the scriptures should be translated from the original Greek and the Hebrew, with the newer “critical” editions 
  <br>of the Bible being more accurate. However, we use the Vulgate in order to make a smoother translation, as it has more room
  <br>for dynamism while remaining faithful to the original Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. So we will use the Clementine Vulgate as
  <br>our text for this reason along with the text of the original Douai and Reims Bible. The fact that there are no copyright 
  <br>restrictions makes it all the more expedient to continue in this spirit. Most words re-translated are from the Clementine 
  <br>Vulgate with consultation from the original sources along with the following: the Challoner revision of the Douay Rheims 
  <br>Bible, the Catholic Public Domain Version of the Sacred Bible, and the Knox Bible. What is commonly marketed as the Douai
  <br>Reims Bible is the post-1730 revision by the venerable Bishop Richard Challoner. However, his translation was viewed by many
  <br>as a significant deviation from the original Douay and Rheims translation. We will use a faithfful transcription of the
  <br>original Bible by Patrick Madueke with some words updated. In order to facilitate a better reading experience the grammar 
  <br>will be reconstructed but there will be no unnecessary deviations from the Latin Vulgate.

  <br><br><b>The purpose of this work.</b> The purpose of this Bible is to make the content of the Douai Reims Bible, long regarded 
  <br>as traditional and orthodox, more accessible to the youth, with simpler words, and instructional and meditative content, 
  <br>especially for children and those who do not have a fully formed English proficiency, while remaining faithful to the Latin 
  <br>Vulgate in the spirit of the Douay-Rheims Bible. Historically, Bible reading was regulated by your spiritual father. This was 
  <br>because many wrong interpretations of the Bible caused problems for the Church.  But ordinary people and ordinary priests who 
  <br>were allowed to read Holy Scriptures did not try to interpret hard places nor to fight over it, but leaving that to the more 
  <br>learned, they practiced lectio divina, which is Latin for divine reading, looking for and finding godly examples of a good life, 
  <br>and so grew in humility, obedience, hatred of sin, respect of God, religious devotion, and other virtues. So, according to St. Paul,
  <br>Holy Scriptures may be rightly used in any language, to teach, to argue, to correct, to instruct in justice and every good work, so 
  <br>that we work to be doers of God’s will and word.

  <br><br><b>Translation policy.</b> We are careful to ensure that the Latin text is represented in its entirety and as simply as 
  <br>linguistically possible. Sometimes, we translate the Latin word “ne”, which sometimes translates as “lest”, in a way that still 
  <br>retains the original meaning of “lest”: which can be translated as: “so that not” or “for fear of”. So for example, “lest ye be judged” 
  <br>is translated as “so that you won’t be judged” or “so that you will not be judged”, as the word lest is hardly used, much less 
  <br>understood, by both young and old readers. Most Hebrew words will be left as it is, with proper and necessary explanation. Some words 
  <br>cannot or should not be translated into a proximate translation, so as to preserve the text’s integrity. Likewise, in 1 Timothy for
  <br>example, we do not normally translate presbiteros meaning “elder” or episcopos meaning “overseer” into its proximate translation except
  <br>in some relevant cases, but rather, we see the development of these Greek words to their new Christian context, so likewise presbiteros 
  <br>becomes priest and episkopos becomes bishop, because these English words come from these Greek (later Latin) words respectively. As for
  <br>other words for priest, such as Latin sacerdos or hieros in Greek, we translate them as priest or priestly minister, being sure to 
  <br>distinguish between the priests of the Jews and pagans between that of the Christians. For more details see the translation notes.

  <br><br><b>The need to read!</b> The Bible is not a magic book. It is God’s love letter to people. Saint Jerome, a priest who translated the Bible 
  <br>into Latin, said that whoever ignores Scripture ignores Christ. However, many Catholics, due to the difficulty in reading and understanding
  <br>scripture, do not read the Bible often. On the other hand, many others, like the Protestants, view the Bible as the sole authority of faith,
  <br>when that is not the case. But rather, we must read the Bible as it is, which is God’s message to us, and a chronicle of what some call salvation
  <br>history. For the youth, try to see what you can learn from these stories and letters which make up the 74 books of the Bible. While some do not 
  <br>have that much experience with scripture, some others, through lack of better knowledge, try to use the Bible as a superstition, playing ‘Bible 
  <br>roulette’,  opening the Bible and interpreting whatever they see first as a prophecy on what to do next. Imagine if someone like that opened their 
  <br>Bible and the first verse they saw was something about murder, war, or sin? Another thing to avoid when reading the Bible is privately interpreting 
  <br>hard places or prophecies or reading their own ideas into the text. 2 Peter 1:20 warns against doing just that. Imagine how many people made up 
  <br>their minds about a certain hard verse or prophecy and formed another one of millions of sects, cults, or denominations? One thing readers understand
  <br>is that although the Bible is good to read, even for children, it is by no means a children’s book. There are depictions of war, murder, and sex,
  <br>which point to the fallen state of man and the need for  savior. Do not be disturbed or scandalized whenever you read these passages. The Old
  <br>Testament and in many parts the New Testament are historical accounts which depict a harder and rougher time. Be assured that the catechesis and
  <br>reflections will tackle these concerns. 

  <br><br><b>We must return to the Gospel.</b> In conclusion, dear friends, let us read Scripture in order to know God in our daily life. For there is one
  <br>God, and also one Mediator of God and Man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself up for all: his sacrifice makes known his will that all should be saved. 
  <br>But why aren’t all saved? The Apostle Paul adds that they must first come to know the truth, because without faith it is impossible to please God.
  <br>The groundwork of our renewal in Christ is by true faith: which Saint Paul worked to establish in the hearts of all. In this he confirmed the Romans 
  <br>by his epistle, praising their faith as renowned among the world. He preached the same faith to many nations, but when others called him a word-sower,
  <br>Saint Augustine allowed this term for good which was spoken of the ignorant. And so between harvesters and sowers (planters) in God's Church, he teaches 
  <br>that while the other Apostles harvested in the Jews what their Patriarchs and Prophets planted; Saint Paul planted the seed of Christian Religion in the 
  <br>Gentiles. And so he calls the other Apostles harvesters, and he calles Saint Paul, specially being sent to the Gentiles, as seminatorem, a sower or
  <br>missionary. These two types of God’s workmen still exist in the Church, with distinct offices of shepherds and missionaries, one to govern Catholics
  <br>and the other to convert. At this time in our world, because of many bad works, many spiritual works are necessary to teach and feed all people, because
  <br>some who have wrong opinions preach another Gospel, when in truth there is no other Gospel, and they preach new teachings which cannot save. Others follow 
  <br>them, believing falsehood, but when the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the ditch. But now is the time and now are the days of salvation; the
  <br>time of Grace by Christ, whose days many Kings and Prophets longed to see: and they saw these days in spirit and rejoiced. But we are made participants
  <br>in Christ and his mysteries so that we do not neglect Heaven, because if we receive and keep his foundation, the true Catholic faith, firmly to the end; 
  <br>we build there good works by his graces (without these graces we cannot even think good thoughts but by these graces we can do all things.). But if we do
  <br>not hold onto this ground, the building will collapse. If we say we know God in words, but deny him in deeds, committing sin, or failing to do good, in
  <br>short, if we do not have charity, which is the peak of all virtues, all is lost. But if we build spiritual bricks of gold, silver, and precious stones upon 
  <br>firm ground, that building will stay up and ensure our calling by good works, as Saint Peter says. Therefore, love one another, and pray for one another. Amen.
