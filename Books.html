        <b><br>Nota Bene:</b> The bibles in this repository are in the <b>public domain</b>. You are free to copy and replicate them. 
    <br>Q: <b>Why so many Douays?</b>
    <br>A: The Douay-Rheims Bible and its successor, the Bp. Challoner 'revision' (which, in reality, is very close to a separate translation!) were printed in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries respectively
    <br>and therefore are in the public domain. MEANING that you can copy or make derivative works out of it. Now all works from 1924 onwards are in the public domain. However, there are some works, like the 
    <br>Catholic Study Biblem, based on the New American Bible Revised Edition, which for some unknown reason has been listed as public domain by the Internet Archive. Another version exists, the Catholic Public
    <br>Domain Version, but unlike the Douay and Challoner it has not revieced an <i>imprimatur</i> or <i>nihil obstat</i>.
