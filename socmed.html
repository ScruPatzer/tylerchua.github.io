    <h1><center><font face="NimbusRomanW01-Regular" size="10" color="black">I Am Leaving Social Media</h1>

<body> 
      
<p><justify><font size="5" color="black">Some of you might know me from the social media platform Facebook (and if you were there five years ago, Instagram). Recently I announced that I 
      will be taking my leave from this platform. I am in the process of doing that soon - after I release the first draft copy of my book Ad Theologiam Nationis. </p>
  
  <p> It is unlikely that people will drop by this page - nevertheless, I will be leaving out ways in which you can contact me. 
    
<br><br> EMAIL: I use tylerpreacher@gmail.com for all personal communications with those outside the University of Asia and the Pacific. 
    I don't need to give out my University account since the only people who need it can access it with ease on their mail client. 
    
    <br><br> NUMBER: I cannot give away my number indiscriminately. If you want my number, please contact me via email. Normally, those who I can contact on my phone are 
    people who know me in the flesh. 
    
    <br>>br>GUILDED: I go by TylerChua.
    
    <br><br>  I do not have a PO box. I do not want to give away my home address. </p>
