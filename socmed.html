<p><justify><font size="3" color="black">Some of you might know me from the social media platform Facebook (and if you were there five years ago, Instagram). Recently I announced that I 
      will be taking my leave from this platform. 
<br> The short answer is that it got boring. I recently got enrolled into the University, and I found out that I could do in real life what I wanted to do in Facebook.</p>
